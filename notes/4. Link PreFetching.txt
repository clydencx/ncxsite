Link Pre-Fetching:

    - Any <Link /> component in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data)
    for pages using Static Generation.

    - When a page with getStaticProps is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page  HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running getStaticProps.

    - The JSON file will be used in client-side routing through next/link, or next/ router.

    - When you navigate to a page that's pre-rendered using getStaticProps, Next.js fetches JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props to create the page component client-side.

    - Client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used.
