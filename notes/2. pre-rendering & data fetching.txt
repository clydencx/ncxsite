Pre-rendering 

React vs Next JS:
-By default, Next JS pre-renders every page in the application.

What does pre-render mean?
- Next JS generates HTML for each page in advance instead of having it all done by
client-side JavaScript.

Pre-render just means in advace of sending it to the browser.

Pre-rendering is done by default in a Next JS app

Why pre-render?
1. Pre-render improves performance
    - In a React app, you need to wait for the JavaScript to be executed.
    - Perhaps fetch data from an external API and then render the UI
    - There is a wait time for the user
    - With a pre-rendered page, the HTML is already generated and loads
    faster.

2. Pre-rendering helps with SEO
    - If you're building a blog or an e-commerce site, SEO is a concern.
    - With a React app, if the search engine hits your page, it only sees
    a div tag with id equail to root.
    - If search engine hits pre-rendered page though, all the content is
    present in the source code which will help index that page.
    - if SEO is of concern for your app, pre-rendering is what you want.

Summary:
- Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML with the necessary
data for a page in our application.

- Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

- Next JS supports two forms of pre-rendering
    * Static Generation
    * Server-Side rendering

Static Generation:
- A method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time.
- The HTML with all the data that makes up the content of the web page are generated in
advance when you build your application.
- Recommended method to pre-render pages whenever possible.
- Page can be built once, cached by a CDN and served to the client almost instantly.
    Ex.: Blog pages, e-commerce product pages, documentation and marketing pages.
